EnergyLeveler
=============

A python script to plot an energy level diagram with a use of matplotlib library.

[BackgroundNose](http://github.com) wrote the basis for this script. I have delete some features, changed other, and added a few. 

The repository contains a sample input file and a sample output. 

The script is very bugged and needs some work. 

## Todo
- [ ] names dont work with eps files
- [ ] make the font size be adjusted automatically 
- [ ] width of text has no constraints -- it can overlap with other elements of the figue
- [ ] graphics
