EnergyLeveler
=============

A python script to plot an energy level diagram with a use of matplotlib library.

[James Furness](https://github.com/JFurness1/EnergyLeveller) wrote the basis for this script. I have delete some features, changed other, and added a few. 

The repository contains a sample input file and a sample output. 

This bugged and messy script serves my needs well. 

## Todo
- [ ] names dont work with eps files
- [ ] make the font size be adjusted automatically 
- [ ] width of text has no constraints -- it can overlap with other elements of the figue
- [ ] graphics
